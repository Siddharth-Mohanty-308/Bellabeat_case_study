## Prepare Phase
### About the Dataset

The data source used for our case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, which is open-source and is provided through Mobius. 

The data is stored on kaggle in form of 18 .csv files and is in the long format. For our analysis we will only consider the 3 following files:
* dailyActivity_merged
* sleepDay_merged
* weightLofInfo_merged

### Data Credibility and Integrity 

Due to the limitation of only 30 users and not having any demographic information we could encounter a sampling bias. We are not sure if the sample is representative of the whole population.
Another problem we would encounter is that the dataset is generic and not specific to women this is necessary as the product is focused on women.
The data is also updated 3 years ago and might not be relevent to the trends of current time.
